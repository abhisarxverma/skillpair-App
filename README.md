# SkillPair 🧑‍🤝‍🧑  

### Bridging the Gap in Online Learning  

While taking free online courses, I realized how hard it is to find peers who share the same interests and course journey. **SkillPair** is my solution—a platform designed to connect learners, so no one has to go through a course alone.

## 🧠 What is SkillPair?  
SkillPair helps students taking **popular free online courses** (CS50, HarvardX, NPTEL, MIT, etc.) **find study partners or groups** based on shared interests and mutual consent. It’s like a buddy system for self-paced learners, creating a **network of engaged course-mates**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack (WIP)  
- **Backend:** Python, Django  
- **Database:** SQLite (for now)  
- **Frontend:** HTMX  
- **Hosting:** PythonAnywhere

## 🚀 My Journey  
I’m a backend-focused learner exploring **DSA, Django, and SQL**. SkillPair is my **creative playground**—a real-world project where I apply my knowledge, experiment, and grow.  

Though it’s still evolving, I welcome **stars, forks, and contributions** to improve and expand it!  

Stay curious. Keep building. 🚀
